## Project Description
The Task Manager application is designed to help users organize their tasks with ease. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The task list can be saved to a file, ensuring data is available even after restarting the application. This project is initially built as a console application and can be extended with a graphical interface using Tkinter or PyQt for a more user-friendly experience.
## Features
* **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks:** Provides full control over task management, allowing users to keep their task list up-to-date.
* **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Users can mark tasks as done, helping to track progress.
* **Task List Display:** Shows all tasks with their status (complete or incomplete).
* **Data Persistence:** The task list is saved to a file, allowing tasks to be loaded on startup for consistent data storage.
* **Optional GUI:** An optional graphical interface can be created with Tkinter or PyQt to enhance usability.
## Technologies Used
* **Python:** For core functionality and logic.
* **File Handling:** To store and retrieve tasks from a file for data persistence.
* **Tkinter/PyQt (Optional):** For creating a GUI.
## How to Use
1. **Console Interface:**
      * The application will present a menu to add, edit, delete, or mark tasks complete.
      * Type the number corresponding to the desired action.
      * Follow the prompts to manage your tasks.         
2. **Saving and Loading:**
      * Tasks are automatically saved to a file, so when you restart the application, your tasks will be loaded.
3. **Optional GUI:**
      * If a GUI is implemented, it will provide buttons and text fields for task management, making the application more intuitive.
# Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for this project include:
* **Priority Levels:** Allow users to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
* **Due Dates:** Add the option to set due dates for tasks.
* **Search Functionality:** Enable search or filter options to find tasks quickly.
* **Notifications:** Implement reminders for tasks with upcoming due dates.
* **Advanced GUI:** Develop a more feature-rich GUI with Tkinter or PyQt.
